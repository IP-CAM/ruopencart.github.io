<h1>Returns Report</h1>
<h2>Returns Report</h2>
<p>The Returns Report can be accessed through Reports&gt;Sales&gt;Returns. The returns report shows how many returns were requested within a given time frame. The returns information is displayed in either daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly increments depending on which option you select in the &quot;Group By&quot; drop box.</p>
<p>The Returns Report displays the following information:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<tbody><tr>
		<th width="30%">Date Start</th>
		<td width="*">The date of the first day of the week tracked (if set to week in Group By)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Date End</th>
		<td>The date of the last day of the week tracked (if set to week in Group By)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>No. Returns</th>
		<td>The number of return requests submitted or created between the date start and date end.</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
